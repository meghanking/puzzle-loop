I will post a series of data sets that you will be required to run your program against. You must provide a table of tournament results (submitted under the assignment “Tournament Results”) identifying the time taken to generate a solution for each board. You must provide the move sequence generated by each of these data sets as a separate file. Each solution must be found in no more than 10 CPU seconds (I reserve the right to change this value higher or lower!).
We will verify your results by testing your program ourselves on one or more of the tournament data sets to verify your results.
