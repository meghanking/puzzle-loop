This submission will be used to show what you have as a final program. You will be graded on the program playing a legal game (developing/finding a correct solution), any changes which have been made since the first demonstration, and how well the program plays. Your program should allow humans to play manually or the computer to play automatically. During automatic play, your program should display the initial board, the final board, a list of moves made for the solution, and the total CPU time used to generate that solution. You are to submit files containing your program, the data sets, and a README.TXT plain text file describing how to load your program and any other directions required to execute your program.
